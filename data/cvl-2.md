###### Analysis:

Civil’s CVL token’s design fits within the parameters described in principle 1 of the CTF. The token does not display financial characteristics, such as equity ownership, a predominant interest in a fund, or passive-earned dividend rights. The token does offer the right to participate in curating Newsrooms and content via the Civil Registry. The use of CVL to publish and curate content is a consumptive right, allowing the token to be classified as a consumer token. The actual implementation of this cannot be evaluated until the token launch, but there is no evidence to suggest the technology is unrealistic.

The token unlocks two key business features for journalists: self-governance and permanence. As individual token holders decide what posts to contribute CVL to, the system is self-governing. Through the use of a decentralized ledger, information on the platform achieves permanence. Importantly, ownership of CVL is not in any way related to exclusive or premium content, and purchasing it is in no way likened to a subscription service for the platform.

Within the Brooklyn Project taxonomy, CVL would be considered a consumer token. Through allowing CVL to serve as a payment on the Civil network, the token confers the rights to a “Reward” activity. Through the implementation of a staking mechanism to publish and challenge content, the token confers the rights to a “License” activity. A given amount of CVL effectively serves as a license to add posts, challenge information, or deliver rewards on the platform.

###### Analysis:

During the **_first phase_** the project will be governed by four bodies:

- Civil Media Company: The founding for-profit entity of Civil has three mandates:
  1. Serve the mission, values and ethos of Civil as thought leaders for the ecosystem;
  2. Develop new and innovative uses for blockchain and cryptoeconomics;
  3. Scale and optimize our marketplace businesses.
- Journalism Ethics Council will serve as an independent, nonprofit, final arbiter in disputes that cannot come to a crowd-governed solution.
- Civil Law Review will serve as a nonprofit distributor of funds to Newsrooms in need of legal services.
- Next Fleet Fund is a for-profit entity responsible for developing the CVL token, marketplace, and ecosystem.

The **_second phase_** will see the addition of:

- _Civil Studio_: a for-profit entity to pilot marquee works of journalism, “acting as a producer investing for upside and providing high-level support but not directly involved in the legwork”.
- _Civil Labs_: a for-profit entity designed to develop “software apps, tools, and widgets for the Civil ecosystem” and eventually maintain a consumer and enterprise app store.
- _The Civil Foundation_ is a non-profit version of Civil Studios, designed to provide funding to important journalism projects with less potential financial upside.
- _The Civil Academy_ is a non-profit to foster “appreciation for journalism, media literacy and civic engagement among the world’s youth”.

The leadership of the Civil Media Company is disclosed on pages 21-24 of the whitepaper, where the names, roles and backgrounds of the top 13 members of the company are posted.

- _Matthew Iles, CEO_, studied journalism at Duke before pursuing a career of digital marketing and business modeling.
- _Lillian Ruiz, Growth and Operations Lead_, has 9 years of experience in digital marketing, audience development and business strategy, previously at InsideHook.
- _Dan Kinsley, Engineering Lead_, has over 10 years of experience in launching and scaling early stage businesses and systems, such as Surf and Fuze.
- _Nguyet Vuong, Product Design Lead_, has over 10 years of experience in design and digital launch, previously working for the Atlantic’s creative agency in DC.
- _Matt Coolidge, Communications and Brand Strategy Lead_, has over 10 years of experience in public relations and lobbying, previously working for Bateman Group.

The publishing, challenging, and curation of content are all decentralized. Newsrooms are independent of each other and the Civil Media Company and choose what to publish. The challenging system subjects all published content to scrutinous wisdom of the crowd, in that there is an incentive for successfully correcting incorrect or misleading information. Content promotion systems add a further level of decentralization, in that once content is published, its relative importance can be crowd-determined through allocation of CVL awards.

Conflict resolution is first attempted through decentralized methods, such as crowd-governance through the “Civil Journalism Ethics Guideline”. If a conflict cannot come to a crowd-mediated solution, the Journalism Ethics Council will pass a final judgement. The various organizational unis in the ecosystem are not directly related, serving as a large scale level of decentralization. The CVL token software will be open source, with Civil inviting developers to build complementary apps and offerings on top of the network.

###### Analysis:

The planned token distribution will raise money for the creation and operations of the 8 organizational units outlined above. The Civil Media Company will issue the CVL token.

The sale will use an assessment test to determine eligibility to purchase tokens based on:

- Intent to consume CVL through use on the platform.
- Reasonable understanding of the functions of CVL and its underlying technology.
- A risk profile consistent with purchasing this type of product.

The terms of the token distribution, specifically lockups, vesting, and transfer restrictions, are not absolutely necessary until the token sale. However, Civil could still disclose planned distribution to founders and whether or not there will be a vesting period.

###### Analysis:

The planned and actual use of proceeds, broken down by function line, is addressed above in Principle 2’s explanations of the 8 organizational units. A summary showing the breakdown of minimum, target, and stretch capital goals for each unit can be found on pages 17 and 18 of the whitepaper.

The token sale proceeds and regular updates on the use of funds will not be applicable until the token distribution. The salaries and remunerations of team members are undisclosed.
